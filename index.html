        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>Automated Regression Framework — Orders over FIX</h3>
          <p class="project-role">Problem</p>
          <p>Manual regression took 2 weeks which was time/resource intensive.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Solution</p>
          <p>Designed a modular/data driven Python test framework using Pytest, integrated with CI/CD, and built API and DB validation checks.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Outcome</p>
          <p>Regression time reduced to <1 day; defects caught earlier resulting in faster release sign-off.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>Manual Orders Intervention</h3>
          <p class="project-role">Problem</p>
          <p>Most test scenarios were difficult/impossible to trigger manually.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Solution</p>
          <p>Collaborated with dev team to build a test simulator written in Python to allow the testing of vanilla and edge case scenarios.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Outcome</p>
          <p>Test cycle timeframes significantly reduced and also limited the need for external team involvement.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>Automated Controls Testing Framework</h3>
          <p class="project-role">Problem</p>
          <p>Gaps in front-to-back trade controls (limit checks, validation rules, and throttling) led to undetected breaches and potential regulatory exposure.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Solution</p>
          <p>Defined and executed a comprehensive QA strategy to test key controls across trade capture, validation, and reporting. This included automation of limit checks, negative test scenarios, and workflow testing.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Outcome</p>
          <p>The strengthened control testing framework identified multiple control weaknesses before go-live, improved compliance confidence, and ensured that regulatory and risk controls operated reliably under production conditions.</p>
        </article>

           <article class="project-card">
          <h3>Automated Task Manager Framework</h3>
          <p class="project-role">Problem</p>
          <p>Manual testing of the task manager web application was time-consuming and error-prone, especially for verifying dynamic features like task creation, due dates, and user interactions across multiple table rows.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Solution</p>
          <p>Developed a Pytest BDD + Playwright automation framework to validate the task manager end-to-end. Feature scenarios were written in Gherkin to cover key workflows and Pytest BDD structured tests were developed for maintainability and readability.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Outcome</p>
          <p>Achieved reliable automated verification of task creation, updates, and calendar interactions that ensures the task manager behaves correctly after each update.</p>

          <h3>Trader UAT Coordination — BARX FX Trading Platform</h3>
          <p class="project-role">Problem</p>
          <p>Traders experienced repeated environment issues and unclear test scripts.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Solution</p>
          <p>Created detailed UAT packs and environment checklists. Coordinated daily triage calls.</p>
          <p class="project-role">Outcome</p>
          <p>Smooth UAT cycles and adhesion to project timelines.</p>

      <h2>Testimonials</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “I had the pleasure of working with Chris and I can confidently say he is one of the most knowledgeable professionals in the Foreign Exchange (FX) domain. His deep understanding of the end-to-end workflows for FX Outright, Swap, and Algo orders, gained from his experience as a QA in the front office technology team, is truly commendable.

What sets him apart is his ability to combine strong technical skills with exceptional leadership qualities. As the QA team lead, he led by example, always maintaining high standards of professionalism and commitment. His proactive approach, problem-solving mindset, and dedication to fostering team collaboration ensured smooth and efficient project execution.” — Former colleague
      </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
      "I had the pleasure of working with Chris as my Line Manager at Barclays. We worked together in BARX FX , QA Team from 2007 to 2023. I can attest to his exceptional leadership abilities . He was able to lead our team to achieve all of our goals and deliver high quality projects, even under challenging circumstances. Chris is an excellent communicator, with strong interpersonal skills that enable him to build strong relationships with different stakeholders.

His problem-solving abilities and sound decision-making skills made him a valuable asset for our team. Not only this, Chris is also technically very strong and very hands on.” — Former direct report
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "I had a privilege to work with Chris in Barclays for over 10 years. He is an excellent QA engineer. His testing skills combined with deep understanding of business logic and system internals made it possible to meet many deadlines and deliver high quality products to our clients. Chris’ other strength is being a team lead as he was managing a QA team over all those years. His workstyle is agile and goal oriented. I am sure Chris will be a valuable member in any team." — Former colleague
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        "Chris is very professional, autonomous and proactive. These 3 qualities made him a real gem to have on the team, especially as he was required to work in a completely different time zone to the rest of the group.
At Barclays, he knew the BARX application inside out and had comprehensive knowledge of FX. He would be thorough in his manual testing, ensuring developers were well briefed on the defects/bugs he found, and best of all he would chase up on the closure of them! I would highly recommend him, particularly for lead positions." - Former colleague
